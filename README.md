The subject of this work is to implement a tool for automatic processing of (czech) names of organic compounds into three-dimensional models of the molecules. The VRML language is used for description of the model. It allows (apart from other things) next processing in most tools designated for work with three-dimensional subject. It is possible to control the program from the command line or over the WWW-form. It causes both comfort during common use and possibility of next using by other programs. We focused on processing of the language of the organic chemistry, while the created model is not precise. However, for acquisition of general information about the structure it suffices.
